# Flatiron Learning Code - P5 JS
Learning code created in connection with The Flatiron School in NYC.

This project was initiated after attending a 2 day free class through the [Access Labs](https://www.accesslabs.org/) 
initiative of The [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com).  Different versions of the P5 JavaScript code are 
presented in this project:

/static - first they show us in class how to create the static shape that will be animated by the end of class<br/>
/original - the animated circle in a box that got created by the end of the 2 hour class<br/>
/ - TheMitchWorksPro coding enhancements and modifications I made after class are in the root folder
+ this final version reuses the shape in a function
+ provides some different behaviors for the animation
+ integrates the behavior with URL parameters

## Testing This Code
There is a [web tool](https://repl.it/repls/GentleFrizzyCubase) you can use for free to experiment with the original code 
and the static code provided in this project.  This UI was provided by the Flatiron school.  Note that the enhancements 
made in the tmwp version will not run in this web UI, but you can see the code in action by following the instructions 
in the .js file.
