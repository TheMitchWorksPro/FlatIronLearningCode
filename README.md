# Flatiron Learning Code - P5 JS
Learning code created in connection with The Flatiron School in NYC.

This project was initiated after attending a 2 day free class through the [Access Labs](https://www.accesslabs.org/) 
initiative of The Flatiron School.  Different versions of the P5 JavaScript code are presented in this project:

/static - first they show us how to create the static shape that will be animated by the end of class<br/>
/original - the animated circle in a box that got created by the end of the 2 hour class<br/>
/tmwp - TheMitchWorksPro coding enhancements and modifications
+ this final version reuses the shape in a function
+ provides some different behaviors for the animation
+ integrates the behavior with URL parameters
